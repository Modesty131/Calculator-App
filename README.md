# Calculator-App

This is my mini project assessment for my module one training on darey.io for my 3mtt program. In this project, I developed a calculator App using HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.

The calculator UI and UX is made up of basic HTML and CSS layout which provides the following elements: a display screen to show the current input and result. A button for each digit (0-9) and a button for each operation (addition, subtraction, addition and multiplication). A clear button to reset the calculator, colored in red as well as an equal (=) sign to compute.

Functionality is implemented into the calculator using Javascript. Javascript was used to achieve the following functions: button click to update the screen display. Handle operation buttton click to update the operations. Use the clear button to reset the buttons and operations. And, to handle the equal button to compute the operations.

Furthermore, I incorporated the use of keyboard keys into the calculator using Javascript to provide flexibility in terms of usage. This is part of the calculator's functionality.

Thank you.
